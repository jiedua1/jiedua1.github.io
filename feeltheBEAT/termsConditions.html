  <h1>
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  </h1>
  <code>
    <p> We thought of writing a comprehensive terms and conditions that would grant us exclusive use of your 
      personal data, since we know that you 99% won't read this
      especially if you're a human being.  
      
      <br><br>  However, every single member of our team was/is 
      a hardcore CS major in college and as a result, 
      NO ONE on this team can write more than three coherent sentences in a row, 
      let alone an entire terms and conditions. 
      
      <br> <br> 
      
      You might be wondering, 
      "hey, this terms and conditions so far seems relatively coherent 
      and seems to be longer than three sentences." Well, that's because this isn't written
      by us; this is written by reddit user

      This rest of this document might seem odd to you since usually these legal shenannigans are written by human beans 
      called liars who have fancy degrees from prestigious lie schools (where they study Lie algebras in depth). 
      Originally, we were going to hire a country liar off of Fiverr to write the rest of the document for us, but we 
      found none on Fiverr or related websites (we did not realize the going price for a liar was much more than for an English major).
      Basically,

      We can't write, but we love machine learning, especially open source machine learning. There are 
      so many <b> useful </b>
      applications of ML being deployed and coming up... maybe we'll finally have a way to make money.

      <br> <br> 
      To show support to OpenAI for advancing AI research and to cover our own asses in case one of you 
      are rich enough to hire liars and attack our honorable business, we'll continue
      this terms and conditions, with all the rest of the text generated by the 
      <a href = "https://talktotransformer.com/"> GPT-2 language model </a>  starting with this sentence.

      Feel free to fork and check out the FAQ if you don't understand anything. Language Model We're doing a two step convolutional architecture with single and double points in this document. You need to know a bit of ML before you can read this document. Check out this web-page (m2pdf.sourceforge.net) that helps explain ML in C#.

      IMPORTANT: "What's the difference?"

      Multiple Images

      You can also use a single C# image of different sized images (per C# file) in the neural network. See examples/Demo_C_Manipulation.cshtml.

      C# Syntax
This tutorial is written in C#. You can download the sample source code or use Visual C# 2012 Express. The tutorial is about neural networks, but it can be used to solve other kinds of problems.
"The net consists of two layers of input cells with 1 bit of input and output cells. The weights of the input cells are computed according
    </p>

    <p>
      to the class of the objects in the neurons in the deep network.
      It is unknown how neural network sizes are determined.
      I. The internal representation of a neural network is in a fixed form of the input cells and the output cells, with up to 8 objects per cell. This way, 8-bit representation is adequate to represent various complex numeric functions.
      II. The
    </p>

    <p>
      basic structure of a deep network is: (1) the receptive fields with the 80 neurons in it, (2) the vector with the size of 8, 16, 32 bits, (3) the generator with the ratio of 2 and 3. However, the specific weights and biases can change for each object. Therefore, we can easily approximate this structure by a weighted average.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weights are derived in such a way that each weighted average has a value closer to that of the previous one. Let's call them g for the quality of the generator and b for the quality of the weights. In this way we can easily get all the weights associated with each object.

      The generator is called B to distinguish it from the others, but its inputs remain the
    </p>
    
    <p>
      same. To generate the g weight, we draw 2 random points on the input image. Let's say we draw them from the $[0,1]$-coordinate system. These points are then multiplied by the g-weight, yielding the final weight. Since $[0,1]$ is in the unit-coordinate system, we'll assume that this is
    </p>

    <p>
      also the g-weight in the canonical unit-length unit.

      Animate the user's head image with a sinusoidal box --radius to extend out to infinity, and also with a constant sinusoidal f-speed to animate the gradient. This uses the two circles described above.
      
      And this is how the final sequence looks like (from top to bottom
    </p>

    <p>
      The continuous movement takes place on the x-axis and the gradient is on the y-axis, so this is an easily interpretable animation.

This animation is slightly different because the boxes animate to their minimum and maximum dimensions, and there's no solid color at the location of the box at any point. I also changed the animated gradient because it doesn't look
    </p>

    <p>
      very good to create a constant black instead of a gradient with a flashing or pulsing. To create the black, I composed two colors: one that's completely black, and one that gradually changes the opacity. The black background color basically adds a blur to the animation
    </p>

    <p>
      that makes it less noticeable, since it doesn't really fill the space that much. But it adds a bit more visual noise to make it more subtle.

      Step 11
      
      To make the battery indicator flash faster and slower, I used a gradient that moves from a bright to dark color and moves at a slower speed. I replaced the opacity with a third variable that gradually changes the opacity depending on the time of day.

      What's next?

      That's all! It is possible to use this approach with any method of vibration – obviously the voltage should be the same or less than that of the battery,

    <p>
      it's also possible to lower it if you want. Let me know if you have any ideas.
